 Wade's Theorem 10.16 says that connected sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 are intervals.
 Then the intersection of two intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[c,d]$
\end_inset

 is an interval, because 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\ge a,\ x\le b\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[c,d]:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\ge c,\ x\le d\}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]\cap[c,d]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\ge a,\ x\ge c,\ x\le b,\ x\le d\}=[\max(a,c),\ \min(b,d)]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 counterexample was discussed in class: I drew an example on the board of
 two 
\series bold
C
\series default
-shaped regions facing each other that intersect at the ends, where the
 two regions of intersection are disjoint.
 Prof.
 Schuster mentioned an example that's easier to precisely, concisely describe:
 the intersection of the unit circle and the x-axis is 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(-1,0),(1,0)\}$
\end_inset

, which is not connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

.
 Again, connected sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 are intervals.
 The interior of an interval is an interval.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, two circles that meet at a single point are connected, but their interior
 is not.

 We are asked to show that if 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is compact and connected, and if for every 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

, there exists an open ball 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{x}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in B_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=f(y)$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in B_{x}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is constant on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's tempting to argue as follows: suppose not.
 Then there would have to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\ne f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 But consider a path 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 (a mapping from 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

) between 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\in B_{x}\cap P$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)=f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Then let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}=B_{y_{1}}\cap P$
\end_inset

.
 It is also the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y_{2})=f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Continue in this way until we get to 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, implying 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Contradiction!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that doesn't work, because it's assuming path-connectedness, which is
 stronger than connectedness.
 It also wasn't clear to me why compactness is relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Posing the problem to the Claude LLM (
\emph on
claude.ai
\emph default
) gave me the hint I needed to finish the proof in my own words.
 Consider some 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}\in X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{0}\in X$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\ne f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Then consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\{x\in X:f(x)=f(x_{0})\}$
\end_inset

, which is open, because it's the union of open balls.
 Same deal with 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x\in X:f(x)=f(z_{0})\}$
\end_inset

â€”or indeed, for any value of the function, the set where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 takes that value is open.
 But then 
\begin_inset Formula $U\cap U^{\complement}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U\cup U^{\complement}=X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\complement}$
\end_inset

 is open (because it's a union of open sets), which is a disconnection.
 Contradiction! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm still not sure why compactness is relevant; it seems like the proof
 goes through without it.
 (Claude and OpenAI o1-preview don't know, either.)

 We can appeal to exercise 10.3.8, which established that a set 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is open (respectively closed) in a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 iff there is an open (respectively closed) set 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 in the superspace such that 
\begin_inset Formula $V=W\cap E$
\end_inset

.
 This establishes a correspondence between open covers and relatively open
 covers of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 and the space itself are clopen.
 This is one of the topology axioms.
 But the topology axioms are themselves generalizations of what can be seen
 of metric spaces on their own terms: 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is vacuously open.
 (All conditional statements of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If a point is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

, [...]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are true because no points are in 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

, including the has-an-open-ball-around-it-contained-in-the-set criterion
 for openness.) But 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is also closed, because its complement is the whole space, which is open,
 because every ball around every point is entirely contained in the space.
 But the entire space is also closed, because its complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is open.

 Suppose we have a third clopen set 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L\cup L^{\complement}$
\end_inset

 is a disconnection: the union comprises the entire space, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is open (because it's clopen), and 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\complement}$
\end_inset

 is open because its complement 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is closed (because it's clopen).

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

) We want to show that every nonempty 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq X$
\end_inset

 having nonempty boundary implies 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is connected.
 Suppose by contraposition that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is not connected, being the disjoint union of nonempty open sets 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Then we need to show that there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq X$
\end_inset

 with empty boundary.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\partial U$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is open, there exists an open ball around 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 entirely contained within 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, which implies that it's not the case that every open ball around 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\complement}=V$
\end_inset

, which contradicts the claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\partial U$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial U$
\end_inset

 is empty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

) We want to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 being connected implies every nonempty 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq X$
\end_inset

 has nonempty boundary.
 Suppose by contraposition that we have a nonempty 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subseteq X$
\end_inset

 with empty boundary.
 So there are no points around which every ball intersects both 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is open, because around every point, we can draw a ball entirely within
 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 (If we couldn't, then there would be a point in 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 around which every ball intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

, which would be on the boundary.) But you could apply that same reasoning
 with the roles of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

 reversed, which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

 is also open, which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is also closed.
 But if 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is closed and open, then 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is not connected by exercise 10.5.8b above.

 Polygonal connectedness implies path-connectedness (because a polygonal
 path is a path).
 Path-connectedness implies connectedness, as was discussed in class.

 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in U$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $U\subseteq E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is open, there exists an open ball around 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 contained entirely within 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 (if not necessarily 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 as far as we know yet).
 But then any point 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in that ball can be polygonally connected to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and thus to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}.$
\end_inset

 So the ball is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 But if a generic point in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 has an open ball around it contained within 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is open.

 Suppose not.
 Then there would be two points 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in our open connected set which are not polygonally connected.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 be the set of points that are polygonally connected to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 be the set of points polygonally connected to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 By part b, 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are open.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $U\cap V=\emptyset$
\end_inset

, because if they weren't, the intersection would contain points that are
 polygonally connected to both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 (such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 would be polygonally connected to each other).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $U\cup V$
\end_inset

 is our entire set, then we have a disconnection, a contradiction.
 If not, then take a point 
\begin_inset Formula $z\notin U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\notin V$
\end_inset

, and form the set of points polygonally connected to it, 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is open, so the union of open sets 
\begin_inset Formula $(W\cup V)$
\end_inset

 is open, so 
\begin_inset Formula $U\cup(V\cup W)$
\end_inset

 is also a disconnection.
 Repeat as necessary.
