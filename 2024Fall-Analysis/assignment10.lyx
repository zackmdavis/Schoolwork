 (Union.) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}$
\end_inset

 be an open cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{B}$
\end_inset

 be an open cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}\cup C_{B}$
\end_inset

 is an open cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cup B$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are compact, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{B}$
\end_inset

 admit finite subcovers, which we can call 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{B}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}\cup D_{B}$
\end_inset

 is a finite subcover of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}\cup C_{B}$

(Intersection.) Suppose we have an open cover 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B$
\end_inset

.
 We can

extend
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 into open covers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, by which I mean, for every 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}\in C$
\end_inset

, we can find a set 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}\supseteq c_{i}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{V_{i}\}_{i}$
\end_inset

 covers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

).
 But both of those have finite subcovers.

 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\sup E\notin E$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sup E\in E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

, which is open because 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is compact, thus closed.
 So there's an open interval containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\sup E$
\end_inset

 which is entirely contained within 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\complement}$
\end_inset

.
 Contradiction!

 Take a countable dense subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and pick some 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon>0$
\end_inset

, and put an 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

-ball around every point in the countable dense subset.
 These countably many balls cover all of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, because every 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 is within 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 of a member of a dense set.
 The statement about 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a corollary.

 This was discussed at office hours on 12 November: Prof.
 Schuster indicated that this would be a generalization of Wade's Theorem
 3.40, which we can adapt to general metric spaces.
 Suppose we have two sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}$
\end_inset

 that both converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\overline{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Because continuity preserves limits of sequences, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{n})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y_{n})$
\end_inset

 converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Uniform continuity means the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 we need to approximate a function within 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $d(x_{n},y_{n})<\delta\Rightarrow d(f(x_{n}),f(y_{n}))<\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 gives us our function extension.

 Suppose by contraposition that the distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is zero, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\inf\{d(x,y)\ |\ x\in A,\text{y\ensuremath{\in B}}\}=0$
\end_inset

.
 So for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, we can find points 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\in A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}\in B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $d(a_{n},b_{n})<\frac{1}{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are (sequentially) compact means that they each have a convergent subsequence:
 every neighborhood of the limit of that subsequence contains infinitely
 many terms of the sequence.
 So there are points in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that are arbitrarily close to points in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are compact, thus closed, which means that you can't have points arbitrarily
 close that aren't in the set.
 So the intersection isn't empty.

In

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{|x|}$

 quadrant I and the branch in quadrant II is 0, but they don't actually
 meet (except and until at

 in the back of the book, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\cap H_{k}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\{X\backslash H_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 is a cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 (and thus, of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

) that doesn't have a finite subcover (because the way the intersection
 of a nested sequence of sets gets whittled down to 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is if there are infinitely many of them: none of the 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{k}$
\end_inset

 are themselves 
\begin_inset Formula $\emptyset$

 Contradiction!

 The only convergent subsequence limit of

\begin_inset Formula $\begin{cases}

 For all 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, consider a cover of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 made of open balls of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is compact, each of these has a finite subcover.
 One element of the subcover must contain infinitely many terms of an arbitrary
 sequence (because the countably infinitely many points of the sequence
 are getting sorted into finitely many pigeonholes).
 Designate one of the points as a point of our subsequence.
 For the next point, consider that this subcover element itself can be covered
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{k+1}$
\end_inset

 balls, and has a finite subcover, one of whose elements has infinitely
 many sequence points.
 In this way, we can construct a subsequence that is contained in successively
 smaller balls (and therefore converges).

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

) Having trouble getting started here, so I prompted OpenAI o1-preview for
 a hint; it suggests I should be able to use an cover with no subcover,
 and the countable dense subset, to construct a sequence with no convergent
 subsequence.
 (The hint itself exposes a defect in my thinking: I was imagining that
 separability and the B–W properties were part of the antecdent that would
 get negated in the conclusion in a proof of the contrapositive, but actually,
 they're 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

background
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 facts; the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hypothesis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is just sequential compactness.) Suppose we have an open cover with no finite
 subcover.
 And suppose that every set in the cover contains some points not in any
 other set of the cover.
 (Because if that weren't true, you could remove the set with only duplicate
 points and still have a cover.
 We can select a point (from our countable dense subset) from every set
 in the cover, that's not in any other set in the cover, and form a sequence
 with those points.
 There's no convergent subsequence, because a convergent subsequence would
 imply a neighborhood containing infinitely many points of the sequence,
 and every point in our sequence has a neighborhood containing no other
 sequence points.
