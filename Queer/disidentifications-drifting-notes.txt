Annotations on Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics

p. 1: Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law. (This book was published in 1999, before Lawrence v. Texas (2003).)

p. 3: "Those are just our, you know, synonyms." I'm imagining that the actual broadcast probably said "pseduonyms", Gomez realizes that now, but wrote "synonyms" to emphasize that she didn't know the word at age 11?

p. 23: "It is through the transformative powers of queer sex and sexuality that a queerworld is made." Evocative prose, especially the compound term "queerworld."

Annotations on "Drifting on an Unfriendly Sea: Lesbian Pulp Novels and the Creation of Community"

p. 49: "Claire Morgan's The Price of Salt": for a moment, I thought this was one of the books that the University website erroneously listed for this class before it started (when Prof. Cohler was listed as the professor), but it turns out that that was The Book of Salt by Truong, different book

p. 50: "Therese replies, 'you don't believe that'": I love the Ã¦sthetic of a character telling someone else what that person thinks

p. 50: "that the rapport between women or two women can be absolute and perfect, as it can never be between man and woman": I've always hated this sentiment (I now believe it to be true after all, but that doesn't make me like it)
