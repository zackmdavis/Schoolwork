p. 5: The professional breakdown (writers talk, actors don't) shouldn't feel surprising in retrospect.

p. 8: I can empathize with Queen Victoria's disbelief on a lot of subjects; I used to say I found it hard to believe that sex and drugs were things in real life, not just TV. ("That's a thing? Realy??")

p. 9: Wikipedia claims that no copies of "Spit-Ball Sadie" are known to still exist!!

p. 13: I kind of want to see A Florida Enchantment for autogynephilic special interest reasons. (It's free!)

p. 17: "the two men sit on opposite sides of her on a park bench, each thinking that he is holding her hand. When she rises unexpectedly, they discover that they have been holding each other's hands"â€”great gag

p. 24: De Mille being allowed by the censorship authority to portray sin in exchange for condemning it is a sweet deal for him (the audience might just want to see the blood and ignore the message that it's bad).

p. 31: "Cross dressing, for example, came to mean sexual perversion in some cases" I mean, sometimes it is!!
