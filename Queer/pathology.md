_A Single Man_, p. 29:

> George, thus exposed at short range to this bride of Christ in her uncompromising medieval habit, finds himself becoming flustered, defensive. An unwilling conscript in Hell's legions, he faces the soldier of Heaven across the front line of art exceedingly polite cold war. In every sentence he addresses to her, he calls her "Sister"; which is probably just what she doesn't want.

George definitely has a lot of internalized homophobia, but I didn't notice him identifying much as an [invert as a sexological term of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_inversion_(sexology)). In this clever passage, however, he is identifying as an inverted "cosmic alignment": in a Christian social order that holds that being gay is a sin, that makes him "evil", not from harboring particular ill intent (thus, an "unwilling conscript"), but almost intrinsically. On the other hand, his playing "monster" for the local children and his gruesome "Uncle George" revenge fantasy against "three quarters of the population of America" suggests that cosmic alignment isn't entirely epiphenominal: being seen as evil for something he can't change, a part of his psyche seems to relish "leaning in" to the role.
