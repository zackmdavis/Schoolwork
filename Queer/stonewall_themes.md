The readings in the "Before Stonewall", "During Stonewall", and "After Stonewall" sections of _The Stonewall Reader_ articulate a progression in boldness: the earlier texts overall express a need to hide from heteronormative Society in order to escape its persecution, and present this need as a fact of life: unfortunate and regrettable, but fundamentally not _mutable_, as when Samuel R. Delaney recounts being fearful of confessing his homosexuality in a psych hospital context (anxiously wary of the reaction of one other patient in particular), in conjunction with remembering the quasi-outcast status of the organist at his church as a child.

With the accounts of the Stonewall riot, we begin to see more inklings of consciousness that social change is possible, as in Mark Segal's narrative of moving to New York in the hopes of finding community with other gay people.

This trend culminates in the work of Martha Shelley, who proclaims that "it's too late for liberalism": moderate progressives who think themselves tolerant for not being overtly bigoted are still implicitly upholding heteronormative standards, which Shelley opposes _in toto_.

This thesis about growing boldness is, of course, a statistical generality: it's not that the closet was universal before 28 June 1969 and nonexistent thereafter. A disproof of the latter hypothetical can be seen in the story of John E. Fryer, who gave a talk as Henry Anonymous at a 1972 American Psychiatric Association meeting. A mere three years after Stonewall certainly wasn't enough time for institutions to rewrite their rules.
