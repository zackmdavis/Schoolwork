## Community Assets of Census Tract 3240.03

### [Pleasant Hill/Contra Costa Centre BART Station](https://www.bart.gov/stations/phil)

(306 words)

This is the train station. It's a gem of an asset: whenever I need to go somewhere in Berkeley or San Francisco (including to the University on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the rare Monday/Wednesday/Friday when I'm not ditching my "Modern Algebra I" class which is too easy for me to bother going to lecture), this is what I use, because driving would be a pain. They have a ["short story dispenser"](https://short-edition.com/en/p/short-story-dispenser) machine inside (which actually prints poetry in my experience), which is a cute gimmick, even though I think most people carry smartphones these days and are therefore unlikely to want for reading material to endure a long train ride. The train station contributes to the overall health and well-being of the grand community of Census Tract 3240.03 by providing transportation to people who want to go to and from Pleasant Hill to other areas in the greater geographical Bay Area. The trains aren't always on time, but that's so much better than not having any trains at all. This station is on the Yellow Line. (I think they actually started naming the lines by colors in official BART announcements relatively recently; it was always yellow on the system map, but the transit authorities used to be more pointed about only referring to it at the SFO–Antioch or Pittsburg/Bay Point line. So, the benefits it delivers to the community are limited by it not being able to directly go on other lines, like the Blue Line to Pleasanton or the Green and Orangle Lines, which I have it on good authority go all the way to San Jose! Still, having to transfer at MacArthur is not a great sickness sapping the health of the commuinty in relative terms.

### [Iron Horse Regional Trail](https://www.ebparks.org/trails/interpark/iron-horseI )

(303 words)

This is a paved trail that extends a long way in either direction—I don't know exactly how far, but one time in late 2023 when I was avoiding checking the comments on [pt. 3 of my memoir](http://unremediatedgender.space/2023/Dec/if-clarity-seems-like-death-to-them/), I walked all the way to the strip mall in Concord where Fry's was before Fry's didn't survive the pandemic, which is really far. I often run here in the morning (2.4 miles from the IMT leasing office to Monument Blvd. and back, or sometimes 1.2 miles to Hookston Rd. and back) so that I don't get fat and die.

The Iron Horse Regional Trail contributes to the overall health and well-being of the grand community of Census Tract 3240.03 by providing a place for foot and bicycle traffic to go all around the area, in a way that is relatively unmolested by cars and other automobiles. Many a family has enjoyed a walk on the trail, many a hiker has found respite and beauty in its senic compact, the way weaves glisteningly through the darkness of a Bay Area and Contra Costa County that otherwise would seem indifferent to the plight of its merry citizens and their merry men. The concrete trail surface may actually be a detriment to health insofar as it is a hard surface to walk on and might injure people's knees, but you never know—maybe some people's knees are adaptive and don't mind the shock? The trail's benefits to the community are multiplied by all the other assets that happen to be along the trail, so that's a bonus that increases the utility of the trail far beyond that of the trail itself.

### [Pleasant Hill Library](https://www.phillca.gov/1226/Pleasant-Hill-Library)

(307 words)

This is the library! It's an OK place to study, but it's surprisingly not as good of a place to get books as you expect because the county library selection tends to be a bit limited—they stock popular-level books for normies and just don't have a lot of the grown-up books for smart people that you would find at a University library. [They rebuilt it](https://www.ktvu.com/news/closure-concerns-for-pleasant-hill-public-library) a few years ago, but I seriously think the old library was better. (It had bigger stacks; when I asked the staff about it, they said they junked a lot of allegedly outdated material from the old collection.) Why would you spend $33,000,000 to destroy the old library and build a worse one? I don't get it.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that I don't get it, I must confess that the new Pleasant Hill library is still yet an asset that contributes to the overall health and well-being of Census Tract 3240.03. You often see mothers and occasionally fathers take their small children to the library, because the library is a safe and nice place to take children. When my sister and niece (Amelia, 4) and brother-in-law visited all the way from exotic Cambridge, MA, I checked out books from this library (and the one in Walnut Creek) to read to Amelia. Reading so many books to Amelia would not have been as economically feasible if I had to buy them all instead of just checking them out from the library! A local middle school is nearby, and who can say but that they supplement their books with books from this library? You never know how community resources will get successfully exploited by crafty community members.

### Interstate 680

(324 words)

This is the big road for cars to go fast! If you need to go other places in the area that aren't immediately in Walnut Creek/Pleasant Hill and aren't near a BART station (see other pin), this is the asset for you. I surprisingly don't actually use it that often because most of the places I usually go are either in Walnut Creek/Pleasant Hill or near a BART station. I guess when I tried out adult gymnastics last year, the gymnasium was in Concord near the Noodles & Company, so I would drive on the 680 to that on Wednesday nights.

No one could possibly doubt in good faith that this highway, this lovely highway called Interstate 680 is an asset that contributes to the overall health and well-being of Census Tract 3240.03, because transportation is so essential to accomplish any other goal, and—while the same could be said regarding transportation about other transportation-related pins on this map, like the train station and the Iron Horse Regional Trail, cars have taken on an essential role in American Society due to how they manage various trade-offs and don't need to adhere to fixed rails. (OK, you do need to build roads, which wasn't a given in the state of nature, but once the roads exist, the scheduling of travel is so much vastly more flexible than is made available by trains. This is especially true once you consider not only passenger traffic, but also the movement of goods, perhaps to stores like Safeway (see other pin on this map). You can't ship goods on BART or the Iron Horse Trail—it simply would not work and would not be economically feasible in any way, shape, form, or mode, or packaging. That's the truth, and you can't perusade me otherwise, because that would be persuading me of a falsehood, which is anathama.


### [7-Eleven](https://www.7-eleven.com/locations/ca/walnut-creek/3116-oak-rd-suite-g-29908)

(303 words)

As with Safeway #928 (see other pin), if you've been to one 7-Eleven, you probably won't be surprised by this one. I don't know if it has a uniquifying store number. (In contrast, I know where to find the Safeway store number on the receipt because I used to work there.) It's pretty convenient to walk here when there's just one thing I want to buy (like some coffee creamer or a snack or emergency bath tissue when I just ran out) but I don't want to drive all the way to Safeway #928.

This 7-Eleven is an asset that contributes to the overall health and well-being of Census Tract 3240.03 because it's a place where people can buy goods, as I have explained. There's also an Amazon locker inside, which is convenient for people who want to buy something from Amazon but live in an apartment where the delivery person can only drop the package in front of the door, but the person living in the apartment might not be home at that time to quickly retrieve the package. What if it were an important package for which the expected utility of it getting stolen is sharply negative, even if the probability of it getting stolen is not that high? That's where the Amazon locker comes in, and it's available at this 7-Eleven. I'm sure it works, because I have in fact used it when I needed to order something but I wasn't sure I'd be home because I've been finishing my math degree at SFSU lately, which has mostly been pretty good specifically because of the graduate analysis courses—some of the gen-ed courses have much lower standards and incentivize bullshit.

### [IMT Pleasant Hill](https://imtresidential.com/properties/imt-pleasant-hill/) weight room

(315 words)

This is the weight room at the apartment complex where I live, which is important so that I don't get fat and die. This semester, I've mostly been going for quick runs on the Iron Horse Region Trail (see other pin) rather than coming here, but maybe that's a mistake because I might get weak and sick even if I don't get fat and die? It only has dumbbells (no barbells or anything like a real gym), but that's OK because it's so close. When I do come, I try to do some assisted pull-ups (with stretchy bands that I bring with me) and dumbbell bench press and goblet squats and 20 minutes on the elliptical machine. The elliptical machine was broken for a few months last year, but they fixed it eventually. The weight room is an asset that contributes to the overall health and well-being of IMT Pleasant Hill residents, who are also by virtue of that fact residents of Census Tract 3240.03. It's important that we don't get fat and die! I actually haven't been going to the weight room much lately because I've been so busy with schoolwork, that I've instead been relying on running on the Iron Horse Regional Trail (see other pin) to get my exercise. But when I was using the weight room, I usually didn't see too many other people there? Am I relatively alone in my ability to use willpower to combat the forces of sedentary lifestyles? They did recently—well, not that recently, early 2024—put up inspirational posters praising the virtues of pushing through pain to achieve one's fitness goals. (Not in those words; I don't remember the words because I haven't been going lately.) Do the posters make it even more of an asset? Unclear.

### Safeway #928

( words)

If you've been to one Safeway, you probably won't be surprised at what this one is like, because that's the nature of chain supermarkets and chain stores in general—to provide a consistent shopping experience despite diverse locations. This is where I do most of my food shopping because it's so close. (But maybe I should make the shlep to hit Grocery Outlet more often because it's cheaper?) When I go in the morning to buy bagels and coffee, I often see Oliva (who was my coworker when I worked at Safeway #1701 back in the late 'aughts). Hi, Oliva!

As I have just explained, Safeway #928 is an asset that contributes to the overall health and well-being of Census Tract 3240.03, because people need to buy food and people need to buy other supplies for their home! Where else would they get it? Okay, that was a rhetorical question; there are lots of other places to get it, not just other supermarkets in the area, but even the Walnut Creek Farmer's Market.

Dear Ms. Haydock:

You might want to work on your capitalization and punctuation. For example, "Sunset Avenue", "Muni", "Fire Station 40", and "19th Avenue" should be capitalized. "A lot" is two words. "Kids' baseball teams" should have an apostrophe.

I can't speak to parks I haven't been to, but I must agree that the bus and Muni lines are indeed an asset—not just to your community, but to all the communities linked to your community by means of said bus and Muni lines. Indeed, according to a [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)-like principle (where Metcalfe was writing about telecommunications, but I see no reason the moral shouldn't apply to physical transit networks), the value provided by serving an additional community with a transit line should grow super-linearly. That includes communities like yours! I am,

Your faithful correspondent,

Dear Mr. Castro:

I'm skeptical that you've really thought through your assertion that you "would not want to [have] attend[ed] any other school" than Rio Vista Elementary. Out of all the schools in the whole world, what is the probability that the best one for you just happened it be where your family lived when you were six? It just seems like too much of a coincidence.

Big League Dream looks fun. I'm reminded of the fictional portrayal of [Home Base](https://cxg.fandom.com/wiki/Home_Base) as a Southern California community asset in the comedy/drama musical series _Crazy Ex Girlfriend_ (where our heroine and friends were often seen in the bar, despite not playing baseball).

What is laser bowling?? I am,
